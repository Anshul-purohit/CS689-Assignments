# Model Folders README

This repository contains three folders, each corresponding to a different model: NLLB, IdicTrans, and GPT. Each folder contains:

1. **Model Notebook:**  
   Each folder contains an `.ipynb` file containing code for both Part 1 and Part 2 of the respective model.

2. **Data Subfolders:**  
   Within each model folder, there are four subfolders, each containing different translations:

   - **Random Sentences:**  
     This file contains randomly selected 1000 sentences of a language.

   - **Translated Sentences:**  
     Here, you'll find the translated sentences in a different language for the 1000 randomly selected sentences.

   - **Original Translations:**  
     This folder contains the original translations of the 1000 randomly selected sentences.

Additionally, there is a **Part 3.pdf** file that contains the question for Part 3 of the project.
