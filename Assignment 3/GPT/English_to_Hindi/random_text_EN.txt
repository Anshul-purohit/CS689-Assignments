Last year was the birth centenary year of Nelson Mandela.
And last year was also the silver jubilee year of our diplomatic relations.
And in our first meeting itself I had experienced his enthusiasm and affection towards India.
I experienced his excellent hospitality during the BRICS Summit in South Africa last year.
Our trade and investment relations are becoming more and more intense.
Our bilateral trade is more than $10 billion.
We are also partners in South Africa’s skill development efforts.
If we look at the map of the world, it is clear that both India and South Africa are located at very important places in the Indian Ocean.
We both are democratic countries filled with diversities.
Our mutual cooperation and coordination on many forums like BRICS, G-20, Indian Ocean Rim Association, IBSA, is very strong.
We are also working together on the reforms of the UN Security Council.
Not only me, whole India and whole South Africa is eager to listen to the thoughts of the Hon’ble President.
Presence of President Ramaphosa on the Republic Day and participation as the Chief Guest, is a symbol of our shared commitment to strengthen our relations.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today attended a Sahkar Sammelan in New Delhi, on the occasion of the birth centenary celebrations of Shri Laxmanrao Inamdar.
He said that Shri Inamdar had imbibed this principle, and his life is a source of inspiration.
He said the cooperative movement can play a key role in the achievement of these objectives.
The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of preserving the “spirit” in the cooperative movement, which he said is still largely intact in the rural areas.
He reiterated Shri Inamdar’s mantra of “Bina Sanskar, Nahin Sahkar.”
The Prime Minister said that today, the farmer buys in retail, but sells in wholesale.
Giving the example of dairy cooperatives, he said that the cooperative movement has the capacity to solve people’s problems.
He added that the cooperative movement is in sync with the nature of Indian society.
First of all, I congratulate all of you for this Regional Conference on an important subject like Consumer Protection.
This event is the first of its kind in South Asia.
I would also like to express gratitude to UNCTAD for having supported India’s initiative and playing an active role in bringing it to this stage.
In such a scenario, Consumer Protection is an important component which enhances and strengthens trade in this region.
It is also very heartening to see that the United Nations has come forward as a partner in this entire process.
Regardless of the nature of business, Consumer satisfaction should be the prime motive.
The capacity of the National Consumer Helpline has been increased 4 times.
Portals and Social Media associated with Consumer Protection have also been integrated.
A large number of private companies have been connected to the portal.
Consumers are also being made aware through the “Jago Grahak Jago” campaign.
Friends, in my view and in the vision of my govt. the scope of Consumer Protection is very broad.
Ujjwala Yojna for Clean Energy, Swacch Bharat Abhiyaan for health and hygiene, Jan-Dhan Yojna for Financial Inclusion reflect this spirit.
The govt. is also working towards the goal that every citizen of the country owns a house by 2022.
Recently, a scheme has also been launched to provide electricity connection to every household of the country.
This also is saving crores of rupees for the poor and middle class people.
Friends, keeping the inflation under control has caused economic benefits to the poor and middle class consumers.
Otherwise, the rate at which the Inflation was rising during previous government’s tenure it would have resulted in huge rise in the budget of the common citizen’s kitchen.
Here, on this occasion, I specially want to inform colleagues from other countries about Give-it-up campaign.
Through Make in India we are offering a platform to Global Companies to produce in India and to make better use of our huge human resource.
Friends, this is a first of its kind conference in this part of the world.
E-commerce and trans-border mobility of people is resulting in increased cross border transactions.
A framework for cooperation is also necessary to expeditiously act in cases related to consumers from other countries.
This will enhance mutual trust and trade.
Creating a Structured Mechanism for Communication, Mutual Sharing of Best Practices, Creating New Initiatives for Capacity Building and Starting Joint Campaigns, are such areas which can be pursued in mutual interest.
Friends, strengthening of our emotional bonds will also strengthen our shared cultural and trade heritage.
The Prime Minister later inaugurated the Patanjali Research Institute in Haridwar district.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister expressed confidence that we will not ignore or forget the heritage that we have been historically proud of.
He added that the innovative spirit of our ancestors must be kept alive.
The Prime Minister said that cleanliness, or Swachhta, is one of the most important aspects of preventive healthcare.
